The ad appeared in today's special “Sample Edition” of the paper that will be distributed to every residential address in Woodford County. The paper estimates over 13,000 copies will be printed and delivered to all residential addresses that are recognized by the US Postal Service in Midway and Versailles, Kentucky."
 
"When it comes to protecting and strengthening Kentucky's pension system, the choice in this election is clear: Attorney General Jack Conway is the only candidate that Kentuckians can trust," said Woodford County Democratic Party Chairman James Kay. "While Bevin claims to be a pension expert, the truth is that he lost money for seniors while enriching himself through 'above average' taxpayer funded fees. It's just more proof that seniors, teachers, retirees and all Kentuckians who care about our pension system cannot trust Bevin to serve as our governor." 
 
The [State Journal](http://www.state-journal.com/latest%20headlines/2015/09/05/bevin-s-pension-experience-less-than-stellar) revealed that Bevin's pension record was "less than stellar," charging above average taxpayer funded fees while losing money for retirees.
