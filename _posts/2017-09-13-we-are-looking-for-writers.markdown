Have you ever wanted to respond to some of the hideous nonsense going on in the world today? Well, rather than yelling at your computer, TV, or radio come join a group of like-minded folks that are channeling their frustration by writing about it. 

We need writers who can convey their thoughts in a passionate yet professional way that will reach across a wide spectrum of people. You will have help and encouragement from many talented writers. 

Contact us at [shelbycokydems@gmail.com](mailto:shelbycokydems@gmail.com) if you are interested!
