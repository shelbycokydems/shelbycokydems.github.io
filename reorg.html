    <div class="info">Every four years, Kentucky Democrats rebuild our party through a process called Reorganization. Starting from the ground up, we select new bodies to govern the party – from precincts to county and, finally, to the state level.</div>
    <div class="info">Additionally, we go through a Delegate Selection process as part of the Presidential Primary process, by which delegates are elected to the District and State Conventions, and – ultimately – to the National Convention in Milwaukee, WI.</div>
    <div class="info">The Party Reorganization begins with Precinct Conventions on March 21, 2020. Nominations will be taken at the Precinct Convention, or <a href="https://kydemocrats.org/2020-reorg-delegate-selection/precinct-member/">you can nominate yourself ahead of time here.</a></div>

          <h5>Precinct Convention</h5>
          <p>Every four years, the Kentucky Democratic Party rebuilds the party from the neighborhood to the state level. There are several levels of involement within the Democratic Party: the Precinct Committee, the County Executive Committee, and the State Central Executive Committee. Electing members to these committees is done through a series of conventions held across the Commonwealth.</p>
          <p>The Precinct Committee is the backbone of the Democratic Party, and the first level of involement. The Precinct Committee is elected at the Precinct Convention. The Precinct Committees are made up of one man, one woman, and one youth (35 years or younger) to represent the Democrats in the precint in a variety of ways. We encourage all registered Democrats in the precinct to run, nominate, or vote in their precinct conventions.</p>

        <div class="reorg-info-block">
          <h5>County Convention</h5>
          <p>The County Executive Committee is the next level of involvement in the Party. The County Executive Committee is responsible for all Democratic functions in their county. The committee members hold fundraisers, have candidate rallies, work at booths at local festivals, and maintain other Democratic functions in their county.</p>
          <p>The County Executive Committee is elected at the County Convention on April 18th at 10:00 am at the Stratton Community Center. The Precinct Committee members elected at the Precinct Conventions meet to elect no more than 20 Democrats (must be equally divided by gender and include one person 35 years old or younger) to serve on the County Democratic Executive Committee. at the beginning of the County Convention, the Temporary Convention Chair (approved by the County Chair) reads the Opening Statement and presides over the elction for the Permanent Convention Chair. The Permanent Convention Chair presides over the election of the Executive Committee. A Chair and Vice Chair of the County Executive Committee are also elected of the opposite sex.</p>
          <p>Delegates and Alterates to the Congressional District and State Conventions are also elected at the County Convention. These delegates attend the Congressional District and State Conventions to elect members of the State Central Executive Committee, the governing body of the Kentucky Democratic Party. Any registered Democrat may attend, particiapte in and be elected to the County Executive Committee.</p>

          <h5>County Caucus</h5>
          <p>On May 30th, each county meets to elect delegates to the Congressional District Caucus and State Convention. These delegates are allocated by the Democratic Registration and Democratic turnout in the two most recent Presidential Elections.</p>
          <p>At the meeting, any Democrat registered by March 19th is allowed to run, nominate, or vote for delegates. As Democrats enter the caucus, they will be asked to sign a statement of support for a Presidential candidate or for the uncommitted status. These statements are available at the Caucus. The Kentucky Democratic Party provides ballots with the names of individuals seeking to be a delegate, along with which Presidential candidate they pledged to support. At the Caucus, those present elect delegates to the Cognressional Caucuses and the State Convention according to the allocation by county or legislative district.</p>

          <h5>State Convention and Congressional Caucus</h5>
          <p>The Kentucky Democratic Party is structured with a board (“State Central Executive
Committee” or “State Central” for short), led by the party officers (Chair, Vice Chair, Treasurer,
Secretary), and supported by the staff team who executes the day-to-day operations. State
Central is made up of representatives from all Congressional Districts (elected at the District
Conventions) and At-Large members (elected at the State Convention).</p>
          <p>At the Congressional District Caucus, delegats who were elected at the County Caucus gather to elect the Congressional District delegates to the National Convention. This year Kentucky has 36, all of whom are elected at the Congressional District Caucus.</p>
          <p>Each Congressional District's delegate allocation is based on Democratic Votes in the last Presidential Election and the most recent Gubernatorial Elections. The allocation breakdown looks like this:</p>
