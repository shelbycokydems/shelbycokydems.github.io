    <div class="info">Reorganization is the process of electing new bodies within the Kentucky Democratic Party, from the precincts to counties (and legislative districts if you live in Fayette or Jefferson County) and, finally, to the state level. This process normally takes place during presidential election years; however, because of COVID-19, we moved it to 2021. Because we are still in a pandemic, all meetings, nominations and voting for Reorganization will take place virtually. In all steps, we are enabling Democrats to participate via electronic nominating and voting, or over the phone.</div>

    <div class="info">The process happens in these steps:
      <ul>
        <li>Precinct Conventions</li>
        <li>County Conventions</li>
        <li>Congressional District Conventions</li>
        <li>State Convention</li>
      </ul>

          <h5>Precinct Convention</h5>
          <p>All Democrats who are registered to vote prior to April 8, 2021 can participate in the precinct conventions. During the precinct conventions, a Precinct Committee is elected for every precinct (the lowest defined voting district). The Precinct Committee is made up of a man, woman, and youth member (35 years of age or younger). Non-binary persons are taken into consideration in the process. You may nominate yourself or another Democrat in your precinct beginning on March 15, 2021. Sign up at the link above to get a reminder when the nominations open. Precinct conventions are called to order in a statewide virtual event on April 10, nominations close on April 12, and voting takes place April 15-17. Results of who was elected to the Precinct Committee are available on April 21. All Democrats who participated in the precinct convention (even if they’re not on the Committee) will then vote on a Chair – choosing between the members who were elected to the Precinct Committee. The nominating and voting processes for a Precinct Committee Chair take place between April 22-26. Results of the Precinct Chair elections are available on April 28, thus concluding the precinct conventions.</p>

          <h5>County Convention</h5>
          <p>The Precinct Committee members nominate and vote in the county conventions. During the county conventions, the following elections take place:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>County Executive Committee Members,</li>
            <li>Delegates and alternate(s) from your county to serve at the District and State Conventions, and</li>
            <li>A representative and an alternate from your county to serve on the Credentials Committee to the District and State Conventions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>County Executive Committees consist of equal numbers of men and women, with at least 10 people and no more than 20 (unless your County Executive Committee is already larger than that). Non-binary persons will be taken into consideration in the voting process.</p>
          <p>Only Precinct Committee members can nominate and vote on the positions above; however, any Democrat registered by April 8, 2021 can run for any of those positions. Nominations take place between April 29 – May 10, 2021. The county conventions will be called to order in a statewide, virtual event on May 10, 2021. Voting takes place between May 15-18. Results are posted on May 21.</p>
          <p>At that point, the newly elected County Executive Committee can nominate a County Chair and Vice Chair between May 23-24, and nominees are notified on May 25. The County Chair and Vice Chair both must have been elected to the County Executive Committee, and must be of opposite genders. The newly elected County Executive Committees are responsible for calling a meeting to then hold the elections. This meeting must take place after May 25 and before June 4, 2021, and it must be virtual with the option for people to call-in. The KDP staff and Reorganization Committee and volunteers are on-hand to assist in those meetings and voting.</p>

          <h5>Congressional District Conventions</h5>
          <p>The delegates elected during the county or LD conventions nominate and vote in the congressional district conventions (often referred to as just “district conventions.”) During the district conventions, five (5) Democrats from the Congressional District are elected to serve on the State Central Executive Committee (SCEC). The five Congressional District members on SCEC are two (2) men, two (2) women, and one (1) youth (age 35 or younger). Nominations for District representatives on State Central are open between June 5-26. Any Democrat registered by April 8 can run for any of these five positions. The district conventions take place on June 26 at 10 am ET via webinar with a call-in option. Additional nominations may be taken from the floor. People who are nominated have an allotted time to make a speech or can submit a recording or written statement. Ballots are then distributed electronically for immediate voting, with a call-in option.</p>

During the State Conventions, nine (9) Democrats are elected to serve as At-Large members on the State Central Executive Committee (SCEC). Nominations for At-Large State Central members are open between June 5-26. Any Democrat registered by April 8 can run for any of these nine positions. The State Convention takes place on June 26 at 2 pm ET via webinar with a call-in option. Additional nominations may be taken from the floor.
