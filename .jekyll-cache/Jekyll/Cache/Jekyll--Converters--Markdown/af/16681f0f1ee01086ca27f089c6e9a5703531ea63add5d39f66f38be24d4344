I"3<p>Eleven years ago our 36 year old son, Scott, was a fireman and training for an Ironman Triathlon when he was suddenly stricken with a virus that attacked his heart muscle.  It caused a problem called Cardiomyopathy, a weakening of the heart muscle.  He was in the hospital in critical care the first year for more than six months.  As the years passed he was in and out of the hospital on many occasions each year. The fear of that late phone call in the night bearing tragic news was a constant burden.  Fortunately he had health insurance at that time.</p>
