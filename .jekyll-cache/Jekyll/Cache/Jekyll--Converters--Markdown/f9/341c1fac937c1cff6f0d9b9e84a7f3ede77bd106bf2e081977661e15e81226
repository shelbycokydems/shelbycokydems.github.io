I"˜<p>The older I get, the more I realize how little I knowâ€”or maybe more accurately, the more I realize how much Iâ€™ve forgotten. There are things that we as children understand, but as we get olderâ€”and often more self-centeredâŽ¯we tell ourselves that life is more complicated than that, and we start to bend rules and maybe even break them, rules we know in our bones we shouldnâ€™t bend or break.</p>
