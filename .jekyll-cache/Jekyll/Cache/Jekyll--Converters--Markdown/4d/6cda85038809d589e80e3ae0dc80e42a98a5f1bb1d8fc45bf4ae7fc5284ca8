<p>The ad appeared in todayâ€™s special â€œSample Editionâ€ of the paper that will be distributed to every residential address in Woodford County. The paper estimates over 13,000 copies will be printed and delivered to all residential addresses that are recognized by the US Postal Service in Midway and Versailles, Kentucky.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhen it comes to protecting and strengthening Kentuckyâ€™s pension system, the choice in this election is clear: Attorney General Jack Conway is the only candidate that Kentuckians can trust,â€ said Woodford County Democratic Party Chairman James Kay. â€œWhile Bevin claims to be a pension expert, the truth is that he lost money for seniors while enriching himself through â€˜above averageâ€™ taxpayer funded fees. Itâ€™s just more proof that seniors, teachers, retirees and all Kentuckians who care about our pension system cannot trust Bevin to serve as our governor.â€</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.state-journal.com/latest%20headlines/2015/09/05/bevin-s-pension-experience-less-than-stellar">State Journal</a> revealed that Bevinâ€™s pension record was â€œless than stellar,â€ charging above average taxpayer funded fees while losing money for retirees.</p>
